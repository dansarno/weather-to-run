    - Okay, so...
    - Now then.

    - "[Incoming Alert]"
    - I've crunched the numbers...
    - Yeah, sooo..
    - Looking... tricky.
    - Well...

    - Soooo.
    - Hmmm, tricky...
    - Here's the deal...
    - Could be worse.
    - Mixed bag coming up.
    - Comme ci comme ça!
    - Neither here nor there this one.
    - This is what I've got....
    - Not ideal.
    - I got this...

  Red:

    - Oh dear!
    - Not today, Satan!
    - You may want to sit down for this...
    - Have you ever thought about not running?!

    - Try again tomorrow.
    - Houston, we have a problem!
    - Hope you like bad running conditions.

  Green:
    - Looks like it's best to run in the NOUN.
    - The NOUN is the best time to run I reckon.
    - Wanna run tomorrow? The NOUN is looking like the best time to go out.
    - The answer iiiiss [drum roll].... NOUN!
    - The NOUN looks lovely for a run.
    - Looking great in the NOUN, I'd run then if I were you!
    - "Q: When is the best time to run? A: NOUN"
    - All green for a run in the NOUN 👌
    - "My pick: A(N) NOUN run."
    - I've crunched the numbers... NOUN is the answer you're looking for.

  Amber:
    - Less than ideal but I'd say A(N) NOUN run is best tomorrow.
    - Better running weather is in the NOUN.
    - If I had to pick (I know, I know, that's my job) I'd run in the NOUN.
    - Your best option is in the NOUN.
    - Not the nicest but the NOUN should have the better running conditions.
    - "Q: When is the best time to run? A: The NOUN, I think 🤷‍♂️"
    - The NOUN is best for a run, that's my best guess.
    - I'm going to take a guess at... A(N) NOUN run.
    - If you're going to run, the NOUN is looking like the only option. Well, unless you love bad weather!

  Red:
    - If you insist, A(N) NOUN run is the "best" time to run.
    - Bad across the board but the NOUN is the better time to run.
    - The NOUN is the best of a real bad bunch.
    - My hands are tied, I have to pick a best time to run, it's my job... NOUN is the "best".
    - ... errmmm... I'm going to go with A(N) NOUN run. But don't hold me to it!
    - Drum roll... NOUN is the best time to run. That was a tough one!
    - Run in the NOUN if you really have to.
    - When can I run did I hear you say? It's complicated tbh, but in the NOUN is your best option.


Selection text 2:
  Green:
    - Either in the NOUN or NOUN works, go for it!
    - It's the NOUN or NOUN, take ya pick.
    - According to my sources, the weather is looking good for A(N) NOUN or NOUN run.
    - You got options, two in fact. In the NOUN or NOUN are both looking like good times to run.
    - "Question: When should you run tomorrow? Answer: NOUN and NOUN are both great."
    - The NOUN is looking best. Not happy with that? The NOUN is also alright I reckon.

  Amber:
    - Well, quite the day! But A(N) NOUN or NOUN run are looking like your best option.
    - I've done a few calculations and I reckon A(N) NOUN or NOUN run are looking alright.
    - If you're going to run, the NOUN and NOUN are your only two options.
    - By my lights either A(N) NOUN or NOUN run will do.
    - Tough to judge this one but a run in the NOUN or NOUN will be alright I reckon.
    - "You got two okay-ish options: NOUN or NOUN."

  Red:
    - If you insist, A(N) NOUN or A(N) NOUN run are the "best" times to run.
    - Bad across the board but the NOUN or the NOUN are the better times to run.
    - The NOUN or the NOUN are the best of a real bad bunch.
    - My hands are tied, I have to pick a best time to run, it's my job... NOUN or NOUN are the "best".
    - ... errmmm... I'm going to go with A(N) NOUN run. But it's all bad out there!
    - Drum roll... the NOUN is the best time to run... or the NOUN. That was a tough one!
    - Run in the NOUN or NOUN if you really really have to.
    - When can I run did I hear you say? It's complicated tbh, but in the NOUN or the NOUN are your "best" options.


Selection text 3:
  Green:
    - Good all round, but the running order is 1st NOUN, 2nd NOUN and 3rd NOUN.
    - All good options but in first place is NOUN, followed by NOUN and then NOUN (but honestly its up to you).
    - Glorious out there! The great weather gods are telling me it's looking good all day!
    - You're in luck, good weather all round!
    - You don't need a bot, run whenever you like, good weather all round.
    - I got NOUN, NOUN and NOUN. In that order.
    - "1st: NOUN, 2nd: NOUN, 3rd: NOUN - but honestly run when ya like."

  Amber:
    - Not the best out there, equally iffy in the NOUN, NOUN and NOUN.
    - Well it has been better and honestly it up to you when you run. Less than best weather all day.
    - I got NOUN, NOUN and NOUN. In that order.
    - Not perfect out there I'm afraid, equally meh throughout the day.

  Red:
    - Equally crap all day, I'm sorry!
    - I'm sure you don't need me to say but it's less than favourable running conditions out there all day.
    - You're not going to like this, but I'm informed it'll poor weather all day.
    - By my calculations, it won't be good running weather condition all day!
    - Bad all day, but if I had to pick the "best" time to run I'd say it will be the NOUN
