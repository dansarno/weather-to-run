    Looks like it's best to run ADP NOUN
    NOUN is the best for tomorrow I reckon
    Wanna run tomorrow? NOUN is looking like the best time to go out
    Drum roll please.... NOUN, NOUN is the best time to run
    NOUN looks lovely for a run
    Looking great ADP NOUN, I'd run then if I were you

  - Amber:
    Hmmmm, less than ideal but I'd say a NOUN run is best tomorrow
    Better running weather is ADP NOUN
    If I had to pick (I know, I know, that's my job) I'd run ADP NOUN
    Your best option is ADP NOUN

    According to my sources, the weather is looking good for a NOUN or NOUN run
