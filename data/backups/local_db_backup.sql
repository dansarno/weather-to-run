f	amber	Your best option is in the NOUN.	0	30	1	f
f	amber	By my lights either A(N) NOUN or NOUN run will do.	0	39	2	f
f	amber	Tough to judge this one but a run in the NOUN or NOUN will be alright I reckon.	0	40	2	f
f	amber	Less than ideal but I'd say A(N) NOUN run is best tomorrow.	0	27	1	f
f	green	Looks like it's best to run in the NOUN.	0	4	1	f
f	green	Question: When should you run tomorrow? Answer: NOUN and NOUN are both great.	0	18	2	f
f	green	It's the NOUN or NOUN, take ya pick.	0	15	2	f
f	amber	Better running weather is in the NOUN.	0	28	1	f
f	amber	If you're going to run, the NOUN and NOUN are your only two options.	0	38	2	f
f	amber	You got two okay-ish options: NOUN or NOUN.	0	41	2	f
f	amber	Not the best out there, equally iffy in the NOUN, NOUN and NOUN.	0	42	3	f
f	amber	Well it has been better and honestly it up to you when you run. Less than best weather all day.	0	43	3	f
f	amber	Not perfect out there I'm afraid, equally meh throughout the day.	0	45	3	f
f	red	If you insist, A(N) NOUN run is the "best" time to run.	0	46	1	f
f	red	Bad across the board but the NOUN is the better time to run.	0	47	1	f
f	red	The NOUN is the best of a real bad bunch.	0	48	1	f
f	red	My hands are tied, I have to pick a best time to run, it's my job... NOUN is the "best".	0	49	1	f
f	red	... errmmm... I'm going to go with A(N) NOUN run. But don't hold me to it!	0	50	1	f
f	red	Drum roll... NOUN is the best time to run. That was a tough one!	0	51	1	f
f	red	Run in the NOUN if you really have to.	0	52	1	f
f	red	When can I run did I hear you say? It's complicated tbh, but in the NOUN is your best option.	0	53	1	f
f	red	If you insist, A(N) NOUN or A(N) NOUN run are the "best" times to run.	0	54	2	f
f	amber	The NOUN is best for a run, that's my best guess.	0	33	1	f
f	amber	Q: When is the best time to run? A: The NOUN, I think ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è	0	32	1	f
f	amber	I'm going to take a guess at... A(N) NOUN run.	0	34	1	f
f	amber	If you're going to run, the NOUN is looking like the only option. Well, unless you love bad weather!	0	35	1	f
f	amber	Not the nicest but the NOUN should have the better running conditions.	0	31	1	f
f	amber	I've done a few calculations and I reckon A(N) NOUN or NOUN run are looking alright.	0	37	2	f
f	green	The NOUN is looking best. Not happy with that? The NOUN is also alright I reckon.	0	19	2	f
f	green	According to my sources, the weather is looking good for A(N) NOUN or NOUN run.	0	16	2	f
f	green	Good all round, but the running order is 1st NOUN, 2nd NOUN and 3rd NOUN.	0	20	3	f
f	green	Looking great in the NOUN, I'd run then if I were you!	0	9	1	f
f	green	Glorious out there! The great weather gods are telling me it's looking good all day!	0	22	3	f
f	green	Wanna run tomorrow? The NOUN is looking like the best time to go out.	0	6	1	f
f	green	My pick: A(N) NOUN run.	0	12	1	f
f	green	The NOUN is the best time to run I reckon.	0	5	1	f
f	amber	Well, quite the day! But A(N) NOUN or NOUN run are looking like your best options.	0	36	2	f
f	green	You don't need a bot, run whenever you like, good weather all round.	0	24	3	f
f	green	1st: NOUN, 2nd: NOUN, 3rd: NOUN - but honestly run when ya like.	0	26	3	f
f	green	I got NOUN, NOUN and NOUN. In that order.	0	25	3	f
f	green	All good options but in first place is NOUN, followed by NOUN and then NOUN (but honestly its up to you).	0	21	3	f
f	green	You're in luck, good weather all round!	0	23	3	f
f	red	Bad across the board but the NOUN or the NOUN are the better times to run.	0	55	2	f

f	red	Run in the NOUN or NOUN if you really really have to.	0	60	2	f
f	red	When can I run did I hear you say? It's complicated tbh, but in the NOUN or the NOUN are your "best" options.	0	61	2	f
f	red	Equally crap all day, I'm sorry!	0	62	3	f
f	red	I'm sure you don't need me to say but it's less than favourable running conditions out there all day.	0	63	3	f
f	red	You're not going to like this, but I'm informed it'll poor weather all day.	0	64	3	f
f	red	By my calculations, it won't be good running weather condition all day!	0	65	3	f
f	red	Bad all day, but if I had to pick the "best" time to run I'd say it will be the NOUN	0	66	3	f
f	green	I've crunched the numbers... NOUN is the answer you're looking for.	0	13	1	f
f	green	The NOUN looks lovely for a run.	0	8	1	f
f	green	Either in the NOUN or NOUN works, go for it!	0	14	2	f
f	green	You got options, two in fact. In the NOUN or NOUN are both looking like good times to run.	0	17	2	f
f	green	Q: When is the best time to run? A: NOUN	0	10	1	f
f	green	The answer iiiiss [drum roll].... NOUN!	0	7	1	f
