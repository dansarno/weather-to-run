    Deep Thought::


  - Amber:

    So, you know the drill...
    Here's what we got
    "[Incoming Alert]"
    I've crunched the numbers...
    Yeah, sooo..
    Looking... tricky
    Well...
    Tricky one this
    Soooo
    Hmmm, tricky...
    Here's the deal...
    Could be worse
    It's not great but
    Mixed bag::
    Comme ci comme ça
    Neither here nor there
    This is what I've got....
    Not ideal but
    I got this::

  - Red:
    PSA::
    Alert::

    Panic... panic!
    Oh jeez
    "[Incoming Warning]"
    How much do you like running?
    Do you want the bad news or the bad news?
    Warning::
    Urghhhh
     🙈
    Ahhh, feck!
    Oh dear!
    Not today, Satan!
    You may want to sit down for this...
    Have you ever thought about not running
    Maybe today isn't your day
    Try again tomorrow
    Houston, we have a problem!
    Hope you like bad running conditions
    Have you heard of a treadmill?...
    Deep breaths

    Looks like it's best to run in the NOUN
    NOUN is the best for tomorrow I reckon
    Wanna run tomorrow? NOUN is looking like the best time to go out
    Drum roll please.... NOUN, NOUN is the best time to run
    NOUN looks lovely for a run
    Looking great in the NOUN, I'd run then if I were you
    Q:: When is the best time to run? A:: NOUN

  - Amber:
    Hmmmm, less than ideal but I'd say A(N) NOUN run is best tomorrow
    Better running weather is in the NOUN
    If I had to pick (I know, I know, that's my job) I'd run in the NOUN
    Your best option is in the NOUN
    Not the nicest but the NOUN should have the better running conditions
    Q:: When is the best time to run? A:: The NOUN, I think 🤷‍♂️

  - Red:
    If you insist, A(N) NOUN run is the "best" time to run
    Bad across the board but the NOUN is the better time to run
    The NOUN is the best of a real bad bunch
    My hands are tied, I have to pick a best time to run, it's my job... NOUN is the "best"
    ... errmmm... I'm going to go with A(N) NOUN run. But don't hold me to it
    Drum roll... NOUN is the best time to run. That was a tough one
    Run in the NOUN is you really have to
    When can I run did I hear you say? It's complicated tbh, but in the NOUN is your best option

  - Green:
    Either in the NOUN or NOUN works, go for it
    NOUN or NOUN, take ya pick
    According to my sources, the weather is looking good for A(N) NOUN or NOUN run
    You got options, two in fact. In the NOUN or NOUN are both looking like good times to run
    Question:: When should I run tomorrow? Answer:: NOUN or NOUN

  - Amber:

Weather text 3:
  - Green:
    Good all round, but the running order is 1st NOUN, 2nd NOUN and 3rd NOUN
    All good options but in first place is NOUN, followed by NOUN and then NOUN (but honestly its up to you)
    Glorious out there! The great weather gods are telling me it's looking good all day
    You're in luck, good weather all round
    You don't need me, run whether you like, good weather all round



  - Amber:

  - Red:
    Equally crap all day, I'm sorry
    I'm sure you don't need me to say but it's less than favourable running conditions out there all day
