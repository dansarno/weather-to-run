    - Looks like it's best to run in the NOUN
    - NOUN is the best for tomorrow I reckon
    - Wanna run tomorrow? NOUN is looking like the best time to go out
    - Drum roll please.... NOUN, NOUN is the best time to run
    - NOUN looks lovely for a run
    - Looking great in the NOUN, I'd run then if I were you
    - "Q: When is the best time to run? A: NOUN"

  Amber:
    - Less than ideal but I'd say A(N) NOUN run is best tomorrow
    - Better running weather is in the NOUN
    - If I had to pick (I know, I know, that's my job) I'd run in the NOUN
    - Your best option is in the NOUN
    - Not the nicest but the NOUN should have the better running conditions
    - "Q: When is the best time to run? A: The NOUN, I think ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

  Red:
    - If you insist, A(N) NOUN run is the "best" time to run
    - Bad across the board but the NOUN is the better time to run
    - The NOUN is the best of a real bad bunch
    - My hands are tied, I have to pick a best time to run, it's my job... NOUN is the "best"
    - ... errmmm... I'm going to go with A(N) NOUN run. But don't hold me to it
    - Drum roll... NOUN is the best time to run. That was a tough one
    - Run in the NOUN if you really have to
    - When can I run did I hear you say? It's complicated tbh, but in the NOUN is your best option



Weather text 2:
  Green:
    - Either in the NOUN or NOUN works, go for it
    - NOUN or NOUN, take ya pick
    - According to my sources, the weather is looking good for A(N) NOUN or NOUN run
    - You got options, two in fact. In the NOUN or NOUN are both looking like good times to run
    - "Question: When should you run tomorrow? Answer: NOUN and NOUN are both great"

  Green:
    - Good all round, but the running order is 1st NOUN, 2nd NOUN and 3rd NOUN
    - All good options but in first place is NOUN, followed by NOUN and then NOUN (but honestly its up to you)
    - Glorious out there! The great weather gods are telling me it's looking good all day
    - You're in luck, good weather all round
    - You don't need me, run whether you like, good weather all round



  Amber:

  Red:
    - Equally crap all day, I'm sorry
    - I'm sure you don't need me to say but it's less than favourable running conditions out there all day
